          <p>
            For the past four years, aid flows in Somalia have been tracked through an annual mapping exercise. This report presents figures and analysis based on the 2017 exercise, which was led by the Ministry of Planning, Investment and Economic Development (MoPIED) with the support of the World Bank and United Nations. Past exercises were led by the Aid Coordination Unit (ACU) in the Office of the Prime Minister.
