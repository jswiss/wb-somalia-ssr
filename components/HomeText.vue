      The tree map on this page provides a tool for exploring development-focused disbursements by location and sector. It includes some humanitarian activities where relevant for coordination under the National Development Plan. However, it does not include the majority of lifesaving humanitarian aid disbursed in Somalia, which is reported to the <a href="https://fts.unocha.org/countries/206/sectors/2017" target="_blank">OCHA Financial Tracking Service</a>.
